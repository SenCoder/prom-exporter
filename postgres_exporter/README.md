### Environment Variables

The following environment variables configure the exporter:

* `DATA_SOURCE_NAME`
  the default legacy format. Accepts URI form and key=value form arguments. The
  URI may contain the username and password to connect with.

* `DATA_SOURCE_URI`
   an alternative to `DATA_SOURCE_NAME` which exclusively accepts the raw URI
   without a username and password component.

* `DATA_SOURCE_USER`
  When using `DATA_SOURCE_URI`, this environment variable is used to specify
  the username.

* `DATA_SOURCE_USER_FILE`
  The same, but reads the username from a file.

* `DATA_SOURCE_PASS`
  When using `DATA_SOURCE_URI`, this environment variable is used to specify
  the password to connect with.

* `DATA_SOURCE_PASS_FILE`
  The same as above but reads the password from a file.

* `PG_EXPORTER_WEB_LISTEN_ADDRESS`
  Address to listen on for web interface and telemetry. Default is `:9187`.

* `PG_EXPORTER_WEB_TELEMETRY_PATH`
  Path under which to expose metrics. Default is `/metrics`.

* `PG_EXPORTER_DISABLE_DEFAULT_METRICS`
  Use only metrics supplied from `queries.yaml`. Value can be `true` or `false`. Default is `false`.

* `PG_EXPORTER_DISABLE_SETTINGS_METRICS`
  Use the flag if you don't want to scrape `pg_settings`. Value can be `true` or `false`. Defauls is `false`.

* `PG_EXPORTER_EXTEND_QUERY_PATH`
  Path to a YAML file containing custom queries to run. Check out [`queries.yaml`](queries.yaml)
  for examples of the format.

* `PG_EXPORTER_CONSTANT_LABELS`
  Labels to set in all metrics. A list of `label=value` pairs, separated by commas.

Settings set by environment variables starting with `PG_` will be overwritten by the corresponding CLI flag if given.

### Setting the Postgres server's data source name

The PostgreSQL server's [data source name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_source_name)
must be set via the `DATA_SOURCE_NAME` environment variable.

For running it locally on a default Debian/Ubuntu install, this will work (transpose to init script as appropriate):

    sudo -u postgres DATA_SOURCE_NAME="user=postgres host=/var/run/postgresql/ sslmode=disable" postgres_exporter

Also, you can set a list of sources to scrape different instances from the one exporter setup. Just define a comma separated string.

    sudo -u postgres DATA_SOURCE_NAME="port=5432,port=6432" postgres_exporter

See the [github.com/lib/pq](http://github.com/lib/pq) module for other ways to format the connection string.
